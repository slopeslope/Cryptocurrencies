# Cryptocurrencies

The objective of this project was to prepare data through unsupervised machine learning models to find out what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped toward creating a classification for possibly developing an investment product. 

I prepared the data for dimensions reduction with PCA and K-means and then reduced the data dimensions using PCA algorithms from sklearn. I then predicted clusters using the data using K-means and created a few interactive graphs.
